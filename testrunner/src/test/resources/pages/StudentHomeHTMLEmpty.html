        <div style="text-align:left;">Welcome stranger :-) <br><br>It seems you are not a registered user of TEAMMATES. To use TEAMMATES, a course instructor has to add you to a course first. After that, TEAMMATES will send you an email containing the link to 'join' that course. <br><br>Not a stranger to TEAMMATES? Could log in before, but not any more? These are the possible reasons:<br>1. You used a different Google account to access TEAMMATES in the past. In that case, you need to use the same Google account to access TEAMMATES again. Logout and re-login using the other Google account. If you don't remember which Google account you used previously, email us from the same email account to which you receive TEAMMATES emails.<br>2. You changed the primary email from a non-Gmail address to a Gmail address recently. In that case, <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7Eteams/contact.html">email us</a> so that we can reconfigure your account to use the new Gmail address.<br>3. You joined this course just a few seconds ago and your data may be still in the process of propagating through our servers. In that case, please click on the <a href="/page/studentHomePage">Home</a> link above in a few minutes. </div>
